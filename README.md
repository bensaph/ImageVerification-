# ImageVerification-
-Takes json data provided by the Google Cloud Vision API and then verifies the make and model of a car in the image. Essentially sorts through the json data and gives you the info you actually want (for a car related program). An application of this program could be in security cameras for situations in which the image of a car needs to be verified and a car profile created. 

-This is only a single part of a bigger project.
